# Albert_Base_V2_training_pipeline

The Albert_Base_V2 training pipeline is a comprehensive process designed to optimize the ALBERT (A Lite BERT) base model, version 2, for various NLP tasks. It includes steps for data preprocessing, such as tokenization and cleaning, followed by model initialization with pre-trained weights and configuration settings. The training setup involves defining key parameters like batch size and learning rate, and implementing efficient data loaders. During training, the pipeline iterates through epochs, performing forward passes, computing loss, and updating model weights through backpropagation, ensuring robust and efficient model training.


Albert_Base_V2 Training Pipeline
This repository contains a training pipeline for the ALBERT (A Lite BERT) base model, version 2, tailored for sequence classification tasks. The pipeline includes steps for data preprocessing, model initialization, training, and evaluation.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
PyTorch
Transformers
Datasets
Accelerate
Logging

Install the required packages:

pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate
Usage
Load the Tokenizer and Model
The pipeline starts by loading the tokenizer and the pre-trained ALBERT model for sequence classification.

Set Up Logging and Device
Logging is set up to monitor the training process, and the script checks for CUDA availability to utilize GPU if possible.

Load and Preprocess Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the response text is normalized to handle specific placeholders. A mapping from normalized response texts to unique integer labels is created.

Tokenize the Dataset
The dataset is tokenized using the ALBERT tokenizer to convert text into tokens suitable for model input.

Fine-tune the ALBERT Model
The ALBERT model is fine-tuned using the Trainer API from the Transformers library. Custom training arguments are defined to control the training process.

Train the Model
The model is trained using the tokenized dataset. The CustomTrainer class is used to incorporate additional functionalities like gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling.

Evaluate and Predict
After training, the trained model is loaded for evaluation and prediction on new input texts.

Logging and Monitoring
Logging is configured to provide information about the training process, including device usage, training progress, and evaluation metrics.
